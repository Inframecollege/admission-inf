## API Integration

The dynamic payment portal integrates with external APIs to fetch real-time data:

### Required API Endpoints

The following endpoints should be available at `https://backend-rakj.onrender.com/api/v1`:

1. **User Data**: `GET /admission-auth/user/{userId}`
   - Returns user profile and payment information
   - Used by dynamic payment portal to fetch student data

2. **Payment Submission**: `POST /admission/submit`
   - Submits payment data after successful Razorpay payment
   - Includes user details, course info, and transaction details

3. **Payment Update**: `POST /admission-auth/user/{userId}/payment`
   - Updates payment information after successful payment
   - Records transaction details and payment status

### API Response Format

The dynamic payment portal expects the following data structure:

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Data fetched successfully",
  "data": {
    "_id": "user_id",
    "email": "user@example.com",
    "phone": "1234567890",
    "isActive": true,
    "admissionFormId": {
      "firstName": "John",
      "lastName": "Doe",
      "email": "john@example.com",
      "phone": "1234567890",
      "programCategory": "Technology",
      "programName": "Full Stack Development",
      "specialization": "Web Development",
      "campus": "Mumbai",
      "applicationStatus": "approved",
      "createdAt": "2024-01-01T00:00:00.000Z"
    },
    "paymentInformation": [{
      "totalFee": 50000,
      "processingFee": 1000,
      "registrationFee": 2000,
      "courseFee": 47000,
      "totalAmountPaid": 2000,
      "totalAmountDue": 48000,
      "totalDiscount": 0,
      "paymentStatus": "pending",
      "paymentTransactions": []
    }]
  }
}
```

## Getting Started

```bash
npm install
# or
yarn install
# or
pnpm install
```

Then, set up your environment variables:

```bash
# Option 1: Use the setup script (recommended)
npm run setup

# Option 2: Create .env file manually
# Copy the environment variables from the section above into a .env file
```

**Important**: After running the setup script, you must update the `.env` file with your actual Razorpay and Cloudinary credentials.

Finally, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
